# NextTrainSchedule
Week 07 - Homework: Provide up-to-date information about various trains, using Firebase and moment.js 

##### _Because that Rock Paper Scissors Game is Too Damn Hard_

## Objectives

Leverage knowledge from the previous weeks, add the following:

1. Firebase - is a free database IaaS offering from Google. It can be used to share persisted data with anyone who is authorized and has the appropriate keys
*This will be a key element of Project One*

2. moment.js - is a open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object and simplies doing time and data math functions 

## Assignment
 
* When adding trains, users should be able to submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination 
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes

* Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.

* Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

* Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

### Bonus Goals

* <maybe> Update "minutes to arrival" and "next train time" text once every minute.

* <maybe>Try adding `update` and `remove` buttons for each train. 

* <no> Make it so that only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use your site. 

## Personal Challenges

In light of the fact this homework is being done simulatenously to Project One, I am only taking one challange.

1. Use *modal* objects to prompt and alert. 

### If I had time

* Create several types of trains: subway, commuter. 
    * Subway: this station is one of the trains on the line and there are trains going in both direction.
    * Commuter: this station is the terminus of the line

* have two display tabs: arrivals and departures
